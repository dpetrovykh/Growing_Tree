The Growing Tree:
This code is intended to simulate a growing tree and show its progress over time.

First Implementation:
Each piece of limb is a node linked to its parents and children.
Each Node has properties for:
    location
    direction
    children
    parents
A tree class contains:
    links to the root node
    functions to navigate the Tree
A visualization function:
    draws a given tree
In this first version:
    there is no growth
    the tree must be manually created
    The ability to organize the data in a tree and see it is the most important part.
    The visualization must be barebones and take up as little time as possible.

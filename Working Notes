The Growing Tree:
This code is intended to simulate a growing tree and show its progress over time.

First Implementation: v1.0.0
Each piece of limb is a node linked to its parents and children.
Each Node has properties for:
    location
    direction
    children
    parents
A tree class contains:
    link to the root node
    functions to update and visualize the tree
In this first version:
    there is no growth
    the tree must be manually created
    The ability to organize the data in a tree and see it is the most important part.
    The visualization must be barebones and take up as little time as possible.
    
Second Implementation: v1.1.0
    Add leaf nodes
    Visualize leaf nodes
    Add sun
    Add sun visualization
    Add sun animation
    
Third Implementation: v1.2.0
    Make it easier to generate generic trees
    Create some process by which new branches are created
    





Thoughts on limbs:
    I could continue to define only nodes, and the limb it represents is implicitly the length between it and the next(or previous) node.
    I could also define limbs, which connect nodes.
    I think I will stick with nodes until properties like mass, are, and COM location become too bothersome
    Even if I continue to represent limb sections as nodes, i willlikely need to create a Node subclass specifically for hat purpose.

Recap of previous notes:
    Limb Properties:
        Coordinates of origin
        mass
        area
        density
        coordinates of COM
        next node
        previous node
        direction vector
    Leaf Properties:
        area
        COM location
        alignment vector
        joint location
        previous node
        radius
    Every Tick:
        Leaf generates energy from sunlight
        Direction of light is registered and accumulated
        Stress in every limb calculated
        Energy is alotted to each node
        Limbs break off
        Random limbs spawn leaves
        Leaves with sufficient energy grow towards light, generating a new limb behind them
        Limbs with sufficient energy and need increase in thickness
        Nods with insufficent energy starve and die
        The sun is placed in a new location
    Energy generation:
        shadows must be considered
